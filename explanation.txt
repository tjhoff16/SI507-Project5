I am accessing the Tumblr search API and getting the last 20 posts from funnyharrypotter.tumblr.com/posts.
For each post I will gather the tags, then count how many times each is used.
Additionally, I will tally how many likes and reblogs each post gets.
After that, I will write 2 csv files, the first will have the post ID, along with how often it was liked and reblogged.
The second will have a list of tags, and how many times each was used.
